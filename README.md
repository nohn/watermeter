# Read a water meter and returns value

Reads analog water meters and provides a web service that returns the read value as decimal.

Turns ![Watermeter](doc/watermeter.jpg) into ```820.5745``` so it can become ![Grafana Screenshot](doc/grafana.png).

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Docker

    docker run -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 nohn/watermeter:latest

#### Docker Compose

```yaml
version: "3.5"
services:
  watermeter:
    image: nohn/watermeter:latest
    container_name: watermeter
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:3000:3000"
```

#### PHP

Requires PHP >= 7.4 including Imagick and Tesseract OCR installed. Beware, official ext-Imagick releases currently fail to install with PHP 8, see [Imagick/imagick#358](https://github.com/Imagick/imagick/issues/358).   

```shell
git pull https://github.com/nohn/watermeter.git
composer install
cd src/
php -S 127.0.0.1:300
```

### Demo Access

After installation, you can access a demo on

    http://127.0.0.1:3000/?debug

respectivly

### Taking the water meter image

I have good results with a Raspberry Pi Zero and a cheap camera. In fact the worse the image quality, the easier it is for the OCR to read the digits in my experience. To see an example, how bad the quality can be, take a look at the [demo image](src/demo/demo.jpg). Sometimes when the meter is fogged, the quality is even worse, but the results are still accurate. Night vision cameras do not provide good results, as it's close to impossible to identify the analog gauges with a greyscale image. Instead, I'm using a white led before taking the shots:

```python
from gpiozero import LED
from time import sleep
from picamera import PiCamera

led = LED(17) # Choose the correct pin number
    
camera = PiCamera()
camera.resolution = (2592, 1944)
camera.brightness = 60
led.on()
camera.start_preview()
sleep(5)
camera.capture('/run/shm/wasseruhr_last.jpg')
camera.stop_preview()
led.off()
```

### Preprocessing the meter image

Your mileage may vary, you have to play around a bit. I run 

    convert -contrast -equalize /run/shm/wasseruhr_crop.jpg /run/shm/wasseruhr.jpg

for equalizing the results and improving contrast.

#### Configuration

Once you have found your way to take images of your water meter, you can access the configuration tool http://127.0.0.1:3000/configure.php. The interface should be self explanatory.

![Configuration GUI Screenshot](doc/configure.png)

After configuration is done, you can access the current value at

    http://127.0.0.1:3000/

or

    http://127.0.0.1:3000/?json

or see debug information at

    http://127.0.0.1:3000/?debug

#### Integration in Home Assistant

In your ```configuration.yaml``` add

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: rest
    name: Water
    resource: "http://watermeter:3000/"
    scan_interval: 60
    unit_of_measurement: 'mÂ³'
```
